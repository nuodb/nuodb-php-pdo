NuoDB PHP PDO Driver Darwin install instructions
================================================

This file contains instructions for installing 
the NuoDB PHP PDO Driver on Darwin operating systems.

1.0 PHP Information
=====================

On Darwin, there are four pieces of information 
you need to obtain from your PHP installation:

1) PHP Version number
2) PHP Thread Safety model (TS or NTS)
3) Location of PHP Configuration File (php.ini)
4) Location of PHP extension directory (extension_dir)

PHP can be used from the command line or within a web server.

1.1 Using PHP from the command line
------------------------------------

If you are using PHP from the command line, you can run the following
commands to obtain the above PHP information.

$ php -i | grep "PHP Version"
$ php -i | grep "Thread Safety"
$ php -i | grep "Configuration File"
$ php -i | grep "extension_dir"


1.2 Using PHP from a web server
--------------------------------

If you are running PHP from a web server, 
create a phpinfo.php that contains the following:

<?php
phpinfo();
?>

Copy that phpinfo.php file to your web server and 
browse it to obtain the above PHP information.


2.0 NuoDB PHP PDO Driver for Darwin
===================================

The NuoDB PHP PDO Driver is located in your NuoDB installation directory.
You must manually install and configure the NuoDB PHP PDO Driver. There
are two versions of the NuoDB PHP PDO Driver that is provided for Darwin.
In the directory /opt/nuodb/drivers/php_pdo you will find the following files:


  INSTALL.txt  <-- this file
  php-5.3.NTS  <-- contains NuoDB PHP PDO Driver for PHP version 5.3, NTS
  php-5.4.NTS  <-- contains NuoDB PHP PDO Driver for PHP version 5.4, NTS
  php-5.5.NTS  <-- contains NuoDB PHP PDO Driver for PHP version 5.5, NTS
  example.php  <-- contains an example program.

Note: If your PHP information does not match the above PHP Version
number and Thread Safety, you can obtain source code for the NuoDB PHP
PDO Driver on GitHub which you can use to build your own NuoDB PHP PDO
Driver that matches your particular version/thread safety of your PHP install.

You can find and grab the PHP PDO Driver from GitHub at the following link
 https://github.com/nuodb/nuodb-php-pdo

2.1 NuoDB PHP PDO Driver shared library (pdo_nuodb.so)
------------------------------------------------------

The NuoDB PHP PDO Driver is a shared library that is dynamically loaded
by the PHP executable. This shared library conforms to the PHP PDO
extension API and must be copied to your PHP extension directory. The
shared library name is 'pdo_nuodb.so' on Darwin. You must copy the
shared library that matches your PHP version information to your PHP
Extension Directory. You can find the php extension directory by doing
a simple "php -i | grep extension_dir" within a terminal. Once you have
the extension directory, you should copy the pdo_nuodb.so library to
the proper php extension directory. 

2.2 libnuoclient.so
--------------------

The NuoDB PHP PDO Driver shared library 'pdo_nuodb.so' is dependent on the 
'libnuoclient.so' shared library, which is located in the '/opt/nuodb/lib64'
directory.

2.3 Enable the NuoDB PHP PDO Driver
------------------------------------

After you have copied the NuoDB PHP PDO driver to the PHP extension 
directory, you need to modify your PHP configuration to automatically load 
the NuoDB PHP PDO driver when PHP runs. You can do this by adding the 
following line to the end of your pdo.ini file in your PHP configuration 
directory (commonly '/etc/php.ini' on Darwin).

  extension=pdo_nuodb.so
 
The pdo_nuodb.so must be loaded after pdo.so, otherwise you will get a PHP 
Warning message that is similar to:

PHP message: PHP Warning: PHP Startup: Unable to load dynamic library 
'/usr/lib64/php/modules/pdo_nuodb.so' - /usr/lib64/php/modules/pdo_nuodb.so: 
undefined symbol: php_pdo_unregister_driver in Unknown on line 0


3.0 Verifying the NuoDB PHP PDO Driver
======================================

After you have modified your PHP configuration, you can check if the 
NuoDB PHP PDO driver is loading correctly.  

3.1 If you are using the PHP command line
------------------------------------------
 
 $ php -i | grep PDO
 
Which should show 'nuodb' in the list of PDO drivers and should also show 
"PDO Driver for NuoDB => enabled".


3.2 If you are using PHP from a web server
------------------------------------------

Rerun the phpinfo.php script in your web browser. The PDO section, 
PDO Drivers should show 'nuodb'.
 

4.0 Running the NuoDB PHP PDO Driver example
==============================================
 
If you have run the NuoDB quick start (run-quickstart), 
then you can use the  example.php script to display information
from the example "hockey" database. 

Example execution output:
 
$ php /opt/nuodb/drivers/php_pdo/example.php
 Array
 (
 [ID] => 2
 [0] => 2
 [NUMBER] => 11
 [1] => 11
 [NAME] => GREGORY CAMPBELL
 [2] => GREGORY CAMPBELL
 [POSITION] => Forward
 [3] => Forward
 [TEAM] => Bruins
 [4] => Bruins
 )
 Array
 (
 [ID] => 25
 [0] => 25
 [NUMBER] => 1
 [1] => 1
 [NAME] => MAX SUMMIT
 [2] => MAX SUMMIT
 [POSITION] => Fan
 [3] => Fan
 [TEAM] => Bruins
 [4] => Bruins
 )
 done
 

5.0 NuoDB PHP PDO Driver logging
================================

When you are developing an application, it can be useful to have the NuoDB
PHP PDO driver log its actions. You can enable a NuoDB PHP PDO Driver logfile 
by adding the following to your PHP Configuration (php.ini):

[pdo_nuodb]
pdo_nuodb.enable_log=1
pdo_nuodb.log_level=1
pdo_nuodb.logfile_path=/tmp/nuodb_pdo.log
pdo_nuodb.default_txn_isolation=ConsistentRead

Just to note, there are 5 levels of logging. Beware that log_level 3 and above
can be very verbose and will grow the log file quickly. It's recommended to 
use these levels only when troubleshooting. 

1 - Errors/Exceptions only
2 - SQL Statements
3 - API
4 - Functions
5 - Everything

By default the logfile_path defaults to nuodb_pdo.log under *Nix 
systems. By specifying a value, you will override this path. 
Note that since there is no root directory specified within the 
default value, the default log file will be placed in the directory
where ever the php executable was used. 


6.0 Noteworthy PDO Attributes
================================

- PDO::ATTR_PERSISTENT
    PDO has the ability to use persistent connections, 
    akin to JDBC's Connection Pooling - but is not necessarily pooling 
    multiple connections. A persistent connection is not closed at 
    the end of the script and is instead cached. This allows another
    script requesting a connection using the same credentials to re-use
    the cached connection. By default set to False. Also important to 
    note, that this attribute must be set within the driver options array
    and passed to the PDO constructor at instantiation of the PDO object. 
    It's highly Highly recommended when seeking performance improvements. 

- PDO::ATTR_AUTOCOMMIT 
    Whether to implicitly commit on every SQL statement,
    by default this attribute is set to true. For advanced users it is
    recommended that autocommit is disabled. This forces the user to
    build a reliance on using transactions. By using transactions you will
    in effect "batch up" your statements. Batching will lead to a performance
    improvement of your scripts/app. 
    
- PDO::NUODB_TXN_ISOLATION_CONSISTENT_READ 
    NuoDB supports several levels of transaction isolation, the above
    attribute can be used to change the isolation level.


    NuoDB isolation levels are: 
    1. ConsistentRead - (Default) NuoDB native mode.
    2. WriteCommitted - Dirty reads are prevented. Non-repeatable reads occur
                        after write. Phantom reads can occur. 
    3. ReadCommitted - Dirty reads are prevented. Non-repeatable reads and 
                        phantom reads can occur. 
    4. Serializable - Dirty reads, non-repeatable reads and phantom reads are  
                        prevented.

    You can also control NuoDB PHP PDO transaction isolation levels from within
    the PHP initialization file by setting pdo_nuodb.default_txn_isolation.

    For an in-depth view of Transactions and Isolation Levels consult the 
    Doc @ http://doc.nuodb.com/display/doc/Transactions+and+Isolation+Levels
